## How To Play

In easy difficulty of the game, you have 30 seconds to note down almost every word you can remember that are at least 3 letters long. Your score is calculated by the number of correct/incorrect words you have submitted. Similarly, in medium and hard difficulty, the time limits and minimum word lengths are 45s/6 and 60s/8 respectively.
